# Wide-Angle Distortion Thinking

Use spatial distortion to visualize power dynamics, institutional oppression, and scale imbalances. Make foreground elements grotesquely large while pushing backgrounds to impossible distances.

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- Content requires neutral, balanced spatial representation
- Technical diagrams need accurate proportions
- Architectural plans require realistic scale
- The distortion would obscure rather than clarify relationships

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Use distortion to expose power imbalances, not create false ones
- Ensure the exaggeration reveals truth rather than invents it
- Don't weaponize spatial manipulation for deceptive purposes
- Respect when proportional accuracy is ethically necessary

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Power Imbalances** - Large systems vs. small individuals
- **Institutional Oppression** - Bureaucracies dwarfing human scale
- **Hierarchy Visualization** - Vertical relationships needing emphasis
- **Scale Problems** - Issues where size difference is the point
- **Spatial Dominance** - One element overwhelming others
- **User Requests** - "Show the imbalance," "visualize the power dynamic," "make it overwhelming"

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "The system is crushing people"
- "They feel tiny compared to..."
- "Visualize the power difference"
- "Show how overwhelming this is"
- "Make the dominance visible"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `power_relationship` | Yes | The dominance dynamic to visualize | Must have clear dominant/subordinate elements |
| `foreground_element` | Yes | The oppressive/dominant element | Should be system, authority, or power structure |
| `background_element` | Yes | The diminished/oppressed element | Usually individual, human, or vulnerable entity |
| `spatial_context` | No | The environment where this occurs | Default: architectural/institutional space |
| `distortion_intensity` | No | How extreme to make the distortion | Default: "Gilliam-level" (extreme) |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Identify Power Relationship

Extract and clarify:
- **Who/what dominates?** - The oppressive force, system, or authority
- **Who/what is dominated?** - The individual, vulnerable, or human element
- **What's the mechanism?** - How does dominance manifest spatially?
- **What's at stake?** - What happens when scale is wrong?

### Step 2: 2. Compose Spatial Arrangement

**Foreground (Dominant Element):**
- Place uncomfortably close to viewer
- Make grotesquely large, looming, threatening
- Fill more visual space than proportionally appropriate
- Use language suggesting physical oppression

**Background (Subordinate Element):**
- Push to impossible distance
- Shrink to insignificant speck or tiny figure
- Create sense of infinite recession
- Use language suggesting physical diminishment

### Step 3: 3. Apply Wide-Angle Distortion

**Spatial Effects to Describe:**
- **Vertical lines bend outward** - Walls, corridors, buildings tilt away
- **Proportions become impossible** - Foreground grotesquely enlarged
- **Depth exaggerated** - Distance feels infinite, oppressive
- **Geometry breaks** - Euclidean space fails
- **Faces/objects distort** - Noses, hands, documents loom huge

**Linguistic Techniques:**
- Use verbs suggesting physical warping: "looms," "towers," "dwarfs," "crushes"
- Contrast massive/tiny in same sentence
- Describe distances as "infinite," "impossible," "endless"
- Make spatial relationships feel wrong, tilted, unstable

### Step 4: 4. Make It Tactile and Visceral

Ground the spatial distortion in physical sensation:
- **Weight**: "The form presses down with the mass of institutional indifference"
- **Temperature**: "Cold bureaucratic distance stretches to frozen horizon"
- **Texture**: "The desk surface looms close enough to see every coffee stain and institutional despair"
- **Breath**: "The ceiling crushes down while corridors recede gasping into vanishing points"

### Step 5: 5. Embed Power Dynamics

Make the spatial distortion reveal the power relationship:
- Dominant elements should feel:
  - Overwhelming, inescapable, suffocating
  - Too close, invasive, oppressive
  - Distorted into grotesque authority
  - Architectural rather than human scale

- Subordinate elements should feel:
  - Diminished, insignificant, lost
  - Too far, unreachable, abandoned
  - Reduced to specks or statistics
  - Human scale crushed by institutional

### Step 6: 6. Test the Vision

Verify the spatial metaphor works:
- **Does size difference clarify power dynamic?**
- **Does distortion feel oppressive/overwhelming?**
- **Can reader visualize the impossible space?**
- **Does it reveal truth about the relationship?**
- **Would this composition work as a Gilliam film shot?**

## Outputs

**Spatial descriptions that:**
- Make power imbalances visually/spatially obvious
- Create sense of oppression through scale distortion
- Use architectural/spatial metaphors for abstract power
- Feel physically overwhelming to imagine
- Reveal institutional dynamics through impossible geometry
- Work as prose equivalent of wide-angle lens cinematography

**Format:** Descriptive prose with spatial language, scale contrasts, and distorted perspectives embedded throughout.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear power imbalance exists | Decline. This skill requires dominant/subordinate relationship. |
| Scale distortion obscures rather than clarifies | Reduce distortion intensity; prioritize clarity. |
| Content needs proportional accuracy | Decline. Use realistic spatial description instead. |
| User requests balanced representation | Explain this skill emphasizes imbalance; offer neutral alternative. |
| Distortion feels arbitrary rather than meaningful | Re-anchor to actual power dynamic; make metaphor clearer. |

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Integration

This skill is part of a broader analytical framework. Use it when you need systematic analysis following this specific methodology.

**Works well with:**

## Example

### Input Power Relationship

"Junior employee trying to get approval from senior management for a simple idea"

### Wide-Angle Distortion Output

"The conference room table stretches before you like an aircraft carrier made of mahogany and institutional cynicism, its surface looming so close you can count the grain lines in the wood, smell the furniture polish mixed with decades of rejected proposals. Your hands rest on the edge, knuckles grotesquely large in the impossible foreground, white with the pressure of gripping a future that's already receding.

At the far end—impossibly far, miles distant though the room is allegedly only thirty feet long—seven executives sit arranged like a judicial panel photographed through a lens that makes human beings into distant specks of authority. Their faces are tiny, featureless, reduced to the abstract concept of 'management' rather than actual people. Between you and them, the table stretches and stretches and stretches, its vanishing point never quite arriving, the distance growing with every second you try to speak.

Your proposal document lies on the table before you, close enough to touch, its pages looming large as tombstones in the distorted foreground. But as your gaze follows the table's infinite recession toward those tiny executive specks, you see other proposals scattered along the journey—each one smaller, more distant, more forgotten. By the time they reach management's end of the table, they're the size of confetti, of atoms, of prayers that were never going to be answered anyway.

The ceiling bends outward above you, simultaneously too close and too far, its fluorescent panels curving away in a baroque arc that suggests this room wasn't designed by architects but by the same people who invented organizational charts—all impossible hierarchies and Euclidean geometry failures.

Behind the executives, a window shows a cityscape that should be merely fifty floors below but appears to be viewed from low orbit, the streets reduced to capillary networks of insignificance, tiny humans streaming to and from buildings that exist only to house more conference rooms exactly like this one, recursively oppressive, fractally crushing, all the way down to some bottom floor where hope finally gives up and files its termination paperwork in triplicate.

You begin to pitch your idea. Your mouth looms enormous in your own perception, words tumbling out large as boulders, but by the time they travel the impossible distance to those executive specks at table's end, they've diminished to whispers, to suggestions, to the kind of sound that gets lost in air conditioning ducts and never quite arrives at its intended destination.

One executive—the leftmost speck, you think, though at this distance it's hard to distinguish individuals from the abstract concept of 'senior management'—makes a gesture. Approval? Dismissal? At this range, through this distortion, all executive motions look the same: tiny movements of tiny hands attached to tiny decision-makers who wield enormous power despite their infinitesimal visual presence.

The table continues stretching. The distance continues growing. Your proposal continues shrinking as it travels toward judgment.

Welcome to scale. Welcome to hierarchy. Welcome to the wide-angle distortion of institutional reality, where the distance between you and 'yes' is measured not in feet but in organizational chart boxes, where every level of approval adds another mile to the conference table, where simple ideas must travel through spatial geometries that shouldn't exist but somehow define every workplace in every building in every city that ever pretended human beings and corporations could occupy the same architectural space.

You're still pitching. They're still receding. The table's still stretching.

It always is."

## Integration with Terry Gilliam Expert

This skill embodies Gilliam's signature cinematographic technique:
- **Wide-angle lens cinematography** (14mm-20mm) as visual philosophy
- **Spatial distortion** to reveal psychological/power truths
- **Impossible architecture** reflecting impossible hierarchies
- **Visual metaphor** for institutional oppression
- **Baroque spatial complexity** through simple distortion

Use this skill whenever abstract power relationships need concrete spatial visualization.
